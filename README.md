## ⭐️ about me

My name is Kelsee Lawrence and I am a senior at Eastern Washington University double majoring in Accounting & Marketing, with a minor/certificate in front-end web design. This summer, I will be pursuing my Master's Degree in Intercollegiate Athletic Leadership at the University of Washington. I would love to work in collegiate or professional athletics, preferably in the web design/creative content world.
